/**
 *
 * Red-black tree implementation. 
 * 
 * Binary search trees work best when they are balanced or the path length from
 * root to any leaf is within some bounds. The red-black tree algorithm is a
 * method for balancing trees. The name derives from the fact that each node is
 * colored red or black, and the color of the node is instrumental in
 * determining the balance of the tree. During insert and delete operations,
 * nodes may be rotated to maintain tree balance. Both average and worst-case
 * search time is O(lg n).
 *
 * This implementation is original from John Morris, University of Auckland, at
 * the following link
 *
 * http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jmor159/PLDS210/niemann/s_rbt.htm
 *
 * and has been adapted here by Lluis Garrido, June 2015.
